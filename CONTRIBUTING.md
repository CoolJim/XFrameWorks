# Contibuting Guidelines
Here is a set of ground rules on contributing
Also, always follow the code of conduct
## Reporting Issues
Reporting issues! Probably the simplest way to help, but often not you're stuck with how to report an issue: 
should I do this... maybe that'll help the developer...
***
Not to worry! Here are some tips:

1. Please Provide us with the code you use (98% of the time, an error with frameworks is that the consumer themselves mis-declared an HTML class or id attribute!)
2. Take some screenshots - It may help us identify the issue quicker than just verbal descriptions - a picture is worth a thousand words!
3. If you can't use a screenshot, describe, describe DESCRIBE! The more descriptive, the more helpful, and easier to find and perhaps fix.

## Pull Requests
1. If you know how to code then that's awesome! If you found a solution to a problem or issue we're having, that's even more awesome! If you did find an issue and know how to code, consider starting a pull request
2. Try to note the issue in the description so we can check it out (e.g. if the issue was called exampleIssue, you should place Solution To exampleIssue as the first line of your description)
3. Please provide the full code, not just the affected snippet
4. For bigger issues that affect the whole document, consider forking it first then starting a pull request
## Ground Rules
* Do not report false issues 
* Do not start pull requests that do not help the community
* Try to use constructive critisism
* Accept constructive critisism
